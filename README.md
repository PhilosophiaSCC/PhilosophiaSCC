# *SCC Philosophy Club*

The Philosophy Club is a space for philosophy majors & students who are interested in philosophy to chat, network, and discuss different topics of interest. This is a relaxed and casual space to fan the flame of philosophical discourse for all. Depending on interest, we may learn Ancient Greek and examine philosophical texts of interest to our club. We may also practice for debate competitions, however this is is a stretch goal. We’re simply, a bunch of students who like philosophy and enjoy having conversations with each other about it. 

Philosophy examines fundamental and important questions regarding the nature of truth, sound reasoning, morality, beauty, God, justice, reality, and the elements essential to living the good life. Diligent study of philosophy will improve one’s critical thinking skills in order to prepare for a career in teaching, law, medical ethics, public service, writing and publishing, social work and religious services, as well as provide a strong foundation for graduate work in various academic disciplines.	

All are welcome!
